Integrating PowerShell and Roslyn
=================================

Traditionally, compilers are black boxes â€“ source code goes in one end and object files or assemblies 
come out the other end. The Roslyn project changes that model by opening up the 
Visual Basic and C# compilers as APIs. These APIs allow tools and end-users to share in the wealth 
of information the compilers have about code. The Roslyn CTP previews the next generation of
language object models for code generation, analysis, and refactoring, and the upcoming support for 
scripting and interactive use of VB and C#.
